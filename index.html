<p>The Ground Air Medical qUality Transport Quality Improvement Collaborative uses the GAMUT Database as a free resource for transport teams to track, report, and analyze their performance on transport-specific quality metrics by comparing it to other program’s.</p>

To facilitate medical transport programs of all types collaborating to improve the quality of care they deliver. This is achieved though the following:  
<OL>
  <LI>Establishing strict definitions for quality metrics that are agreed-upon, important, reliable, relevant and feasible to data gather.</LI>
  <LI>Developing a database and the infrastructure for programs to track, report, and analyze their performance by comparing it to other programs. </LI>
  <LI>Identifying practices used by the high performing transport teams for each of the metrics and widespread adaptation of these best practices across participating programs.</LI>
</OL?

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

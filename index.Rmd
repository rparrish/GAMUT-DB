## The vision

To facilitate medical transport programs of all types collaborating to improve the quality of care they deliver. This is achieved though the following:  

 - Establishing strict definitions for quality metrics that are agreed-upon, important, reliable, relevant and feasible to data gather.  
 - Developing a database and the infrastructure for programs to track, report, and analyze their performance by comparing it to other programs.  
  - Identifying practices used by the high performing transport teams for each of the metrics and widespread adaptation of these best practices across participating programs.
